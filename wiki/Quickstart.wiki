#A guide to get you started with OltpBenchmark

= Introduction =

Add your content here.

= Getting OltpBenchmark from SVN =

First obtain the source code from the svn repository 
{{{
svn checkout http://oltpbenchmark.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ oltpbenchmark-read-only
}}}

The next step is to compile OltpBenchmark, we provide an Apache Ant script to automatically build the system from the source code:
{{{
diufmac39:boltp Djellel$ ant
Buildfile: /Users/Djellel/repositories/boltp/build.xml

build:
     [echo] benchmark: /Users/Djellel/repositories/boltp/build.xml
    [mkdir] Created dir: /Users/Djellel/repositories/boltp/build/META-INF
     [copy] Copying 1 file to /Users/Djellel/repositories/boltp/build/META-INF
    [javac] Compiling 150 source files to /Users/Djellel/repositories/boltp/build
    [javac] Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.
    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
    [javac] Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
    [javac] Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
     [copy] Copying 8 files to /Users/Djellel/repositories/boltp/build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

= Running a Benchmark =

To obtain the list of bechmarks implemented and the complete list of options, run the utility script with --help option:

{{{
diufmac39:boltp Djellel$ ./oltpbenchmark --help
usage: oltpbenchmark
 -b,--bench <arg>    [required] Benchmark class. Currently supported:
                     [tpcc, tatp, wikipedia, resourcestresser, twitter,
                     epinions, ycsb, jpab]
 -c,--config <arg>   [required] Workload configuration file
    --create         Initialize the database for this benchmark
    --execute        Execute the benchmark workload
 -h,--help           Print this help
    --load           Load data using the benchmark's data loader
 -o,--output <arg>   Output file (default System.out)
 -s,--sample <arg>   Sampling window
 -v,--verbose        Display Messages
}}}

The following command for example initiate a wikipedia database (--create and --load synthetic dataset) and a then run a workload as described in config/sample_wiki_config.xml file. The results (latency, throughput) are summarized into 5seconds buckets (-s 5) and the output is written into out.txt (-o out.txt):
{{{
./oltpbenchmark -b wikipedia -c config/sample_wiki_config.xml --create --load --execute -s 5 -o out.txt
}}}
